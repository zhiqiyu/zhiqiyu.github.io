      <title>Fully-Connected Layers (FCN) in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</title>

      <description>Recently, during a discussion with a colleague about his CNN model architecture on remote sensing image fusion task, he mentioned something that was interesting. Specifically, in his network, he used FCN implementations Keras.layers.Dense and torch.nn.Linear in his code, the input to the FCN is a 2D image with many channels with size (160, 160, channels). Traditionally, I think that to pass through a FCN layer, the neuron numbers of the first FCN layer in this case, should be 160 * 160 * channels, which basically means to flat the volume to a 1D array and feed in a traditional neural network.</description>

      <title>Installation of GDAL and its Python Libraries on Mac</title>

      <description>Recently I have been trying to install GDAL on my Mac and I cannot find a way to link the Python libraries to the Python program I am using so that I can import GDAL libraries by the import gdal statement in my python program.
The GDAL is designed to run in Mac OS X Terminals, but the installation include python libraries which are not automatically linked to the program.</description>
