      <title>Install and Troubleshoot Docker Toolbox on Windows 10 Home</title>

      <description>As the Docker for Windows only works on Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise editions, I cannot install it on my laptop which comes with a pre-installed Windows 10 Home. Fortunately, Docker has another product called Docker toolbox. It is specifically released for legacy desktop operating system versions. (Somehow windows 10 home is considered as legacy&amp;hellip;)
However, there are some caveats during the installation and configuration of the Docker toolbox on my laptop, so here are the problems and solutions I found useful:</description>

      <title>Solve LunarLander-v2 with Deep Q-learning</title>

      <description>the LL environ- ment is a simulated environment where the agent needs to successfully and safely land the aircraft in the designated area. The lunar lander has 4 discrete actions, do nothing, fire the left orientation engine, fire the main engine, and fire the right orientation engine. The states of the lander are represented as 8-dimensional vectors: (x, y, vx, vy, θ, vθ, lef tleg, rightleg), x and y are the x and y-coordinates of the lunar lander’s position on the screen.</description>

      <title>Memory Ownership in C Explained</title>

      <description>The memory ownership problem or pointer ownership problem is a problem generally seen in C and C++ programs. The problem is generally violating a simple assumption that there should be only one pointer to a given piece of memory, so that when the memory is freed, no other pointers will point to an address that has already been freed.
For example, you have a main function, in which a pointer gfcontext_t *ctx to a struct gfcontext_t is created.</description>

      <title>&#39;Undefined Symbol: PySlice_Unpack&#39; error in Pytorch</title>

      <description>Problem:
 &amp;lsquo;Undefined Symbol: PySlice_Unpack&amp;rsquo;
 Environment:
Pytorch = 1.0.1 Python = 3.6.0  Solution:
 Upgrade Python to 3.6.3. Seems like this is the only solution.
Update by conda install python==3.6.3 command if using Miniconda in CLI.

      <description>This notebook presents a data preparation workflow that finds same-date and overlapped Landsat8 and Sentinel2 image patches and provide a way to download the processed images to the local machine.
This is a part of the ongoing research project Landsat2Sentinel.
The whole notebook is available on my Github repository.

      <title>What are Fully-Connected Layers (FCN) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)?</title>

      <description>Recently, during a discussion with a colleague about his CNN model architecture on remote sensing image fusion task, he mentioned something that was interesting. Specifically, in his network, he used FCN implementations Keras.layers.Dense and torch.nn.Linear in his code, the input to the FCN is a 2D image with many channels with size (160, 160, channels). Traditionally, I think that to pass through a FCN layer, the neuron numbers of the first FCN layer in this case, should be 160 * 160 * channels, which basically means to flat the volume to a 1D array and feed in a traditional neural network.</description>

      <title>Installation of GDAL and its Python Libraries on Mac</title>

      <description>Recently I have been trying to install GDAL on my Mac and I cannot find a way to link the Python libraries to the Python program I am using so that I can import GDAL libraries by the import gdal statement in my python program.
The GDAL is designed to run in Mac OS X Terminals, but the installation include python libraries which are not automatically linked to the program.</description>
